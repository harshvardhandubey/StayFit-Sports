<center><font size="6"><b>Indians are crazy about cricket and our Founder President, Vijay Patil (bio), is no exception. But for all the passion that the people have for the game, he realised that the country sorely lacked world-class infrastructure for not only cricket, but also other sports.
Hence, Vijay embarked on an ambitious dream project nearly two decades ago: create a sports academy to rival the best in the world. The aim was to support the cause of cricket as well as other sports – tennis, swimming, badminton and so on. The dream is now reality – StayFit Sports has several world class sporting facilities including a state-of-the-art stadium.
StayFit Sports is dedicated to research, development and education in a variety of sports, with the aim of creating a centre of excellence that will put India on the global stage of competitive sport. That said, amateur sportspersons across all ages are welcome to use the Academy’s facilities.
In addition to the Academy, StayFit Sports owns two corporate cricket teams and one club cricket team. The Academy conducts coaching camps for over 200 budding cricketers every year.
In partnership with related organisations, the Academy promotes the interaction of players between nations; teams from India have been sponsored for tournaments in the UK, and visiting teams have been hosted at StayFit Sports here in India. For more details of cricket-related activities, visit the cricket section.
StayFit Sports is a charitable trust registered under the Public Trust Act.<br>

						<h2 class="title"  >One Day Workshop By StayFit for Students Of S.L.R.T.C.E</h2>

							<p> With the academic year drawing to a close, it is a good time to take stock of where we are, and where we want to be. For students, this may take the form of some profound, yet usually-neglected soul-searching.
“How do I determine my life agenda?” “How do I decide what to focus on?” “I find it difficult to know how much I can achieve – am I doing too much or too little?” “I want to do something but my father wants me to do something else – am I bad daughter if I disobey? But then, what about my happiness?” For a 20 year old young adult, about to step into the world, these can be extremely perplexing questions.
A recently conducted workshop by VESLARC for a group of BMS students of VES Arts Science Commerce College, encouraged discussions on these and more. Students articulated their dilemmas, queries and ideas, and were encouraged to identify their skills and accordingly map them to appropriate goals. Finding creative ways of nurturing their interests, while also doing justice to practical realities, was also discussed. The need to invest on oneself, in terms of the health of the body, mind and spirit, was emphasized. Values formed the base of all discussions. At the end, the students walked away with the satisfaction of knowing that they now had a set of “tools” with which to approach such aspects of life.
