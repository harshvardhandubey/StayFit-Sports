Coaches will group students by ability, so that beginners can learn basic strokes and experienced players can enhance their advanced techniques and competition strategies. <br>
For parentsâ€™ convenience, campers may be dropped-off up to 30 minutes before Camp activities begin, and may be picked-up up to 60 minutes after the Camp ends, if young players quietly play board games or read in the break room. (Alternatively, interested students may enroll in an optional lesson to extend their playing day.) <br>
<br>
For EXTENDED DAY Camps, drop-off is between 8:30 and 9:00 AM, and Camp activities begin at 9:00 AM. Lunch/rest/board game time is 12:00 to 1:30 PM. Extended Day campers may bring a packed lunch, or may bring lunch money to order lunch through the delivery that the Center will coordinate. Camp activities end at 4:30 PM but pick-up may be delayed until 5:30 PM. The enrollment fee a 5-day, 37.5 hour EXTENDED DAY Camp is $350. <br>
For HALF DAY Camps, drop off is between 12:30 and 1:00 PM, and Camp activities begin at 1:00 PM. Break/restr/board game time is 2:30 to 3:00. Camp activities end at 5:00 PM but pick-up may be delayed until 6:00 PM. The enrollment fee for a 5-day, 20-hour HALF DAY Camp is $185. <br>

Registration priority is given to full week campers, and single day enrollment will be subject to availability as of 4 weeks in advance of each Camp session. <br>
